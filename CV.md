Hello, my name is Egor.
I'm 28 years old.
I live in a small town called Maryina Gorka. This is in Belarus.
I served in the army until 2020.
Resigned with the rank of captain.
After that he worked at the financial exchange in Minsk for about a year.
 And now, on the advice of my friends, I want to become a front-end developer.
